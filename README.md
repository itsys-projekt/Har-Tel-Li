# Major Step 1:

-> Created new Project -> Symfony

# Major Step 2:

-> Add to Cart Button with functionality
-> Cart is loading Quantity and total price in Template

# Major Step 3:

-> Removed Constants as a class and made it into a json where PHP is reading the different configuration (eg. prices.json, template names)

-> more structure, less spaghetti code...still some spaghetti in there
